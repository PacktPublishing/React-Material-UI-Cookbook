Welcome to the repository for Material UI Cookbook. Here're you'll find all the
code samples that accompany the book and instructions on
how to run the samples using Storybook.

## Installation

The first step is cloning this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Material-UI-Cookbook.git
```

Then, change into the `Material-UI-Cookbook` directory. From there, you can run
the install command:

```
npm install
```

## Running the examples

To run the examples, make sure that you're in the `Material-UI-Cookbook` directory
and run Storybook:

```
npm run storybook
```

This will open Storybook in a new browser tab. The navigation is separated into
chapters and chapters are separated into recipes. The recipe names follow the
those found in the book and follow the same chronological order.
